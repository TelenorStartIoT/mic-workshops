During the first workshop we saw how we could create a HTTP client with necessary headers to make API calls. The second workshop made us experiment with the API and calling different API endpoints. During the third workshop we will create a MQTT client, allowing us to subscribe to data generated by `Things`.

Open a clean directory and clone the working repository (if not already done):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Pwntus/mic-workshops.git
```

Next, navigate to `mic-workshops/workshops/03` and run `npm i`:

```sh
cd mic-workshops/workshops/03 && npm i
```

Wait for it to complete before continuing.
