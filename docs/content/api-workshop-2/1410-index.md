During the first workshop we setup a simple HTTP client with the necessary configuration for making both unauthenticated and authenticated API calls. During the second workshop, we'll focus on actually making some API calls.

Open a clean directory and clone the working repository (if not already done):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Pwntus/mic-workshops.git
```

Next, navigate to `mic-workshops/workshops/02` and run `npm i`:

```sh
cd mic-workshops/workshops/02 && npm i
```

Wait for it to complete before continuing.
