The second workshop will focus on setting up a simple Vue.js web-app with a login form for a user to authenticate.

Open a clean directory and clone the working repository (if not already done):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Pwntus/mic-workshops.git
```

Next, navigate to `mic-workshops/workshops/04` and run `npm i`:

```sh
cd mic-workshops/workshops/04 && npm i
```

Wait for it to complete before continuing.
