Welcome to the Managed IoT Cloud Workshops!

This site contains easy to follow, step-by-step workshops for you to learn how to use the [Managed IoT Cloud](https://www.telenorconnexion.com/managed-iot-cloud/) platform. These workshops are mainly targeted at the programmatical usage of the [Cloud REST API](https://docs.telenorconnexion.com/mic/rest-api/) and assumes that you already have a [Managed IoT Cloud user](https://startiot.mic.telenorconnexion.com/signup).

> **Update 31. October 2018:** The API workshops and Arduino MKR NB 1500 sections have been switched.

> **Update 26. October 2018:** I've added a guide to provision a device in the App Board and how to connect an Arduino MKR NB 1500 using NB-IoT with the open telenor.iot APN.
