The Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to make it easy to write code and upload the code to a board. This workshop will guide you through how to setup the IDE for the Arduino MKR NB 1500 pre-release board that we will be using in the rest of the workshops.

As a first step, download the latest [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) version for your platform and install it.
