The Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to easily write code and upload it to a board. This workshop will guide you through how to setup the IDE for the Arduino MKR NB 1500 board we'll be using during future workshops.

Download the latest [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) version for your platform and install.
