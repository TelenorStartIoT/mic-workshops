Our first workshop will focus on creating a HTTP client with necessary configurations to make both unauthenticated and authenticated requests.

Open a clean directory and clone the working repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Pwntus/mic-workshops.git
```

Next, navigate to `mic-workshops/workshops/01` and run `npm i`:

```sh
cd mic-workshops/workshops/01 && npm i
```

Wait for it to complete before continuing.
