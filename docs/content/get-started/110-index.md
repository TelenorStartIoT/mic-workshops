This section will explain why the Managed IoT Cloud platform (MIC) is a powerful tool for managing your IoT infrastructure and why you should consider using it for your projects.

We'll start with a quick background about the MIC platform and who operates it to get you oriented.

## Telenor Connexion: Platform Development and Commercial offering

[Telenor Connexion](https://www.telenorconnexion.com/) is a branch in the Telenor company with its headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden. Telenor Connexion focuses on tailored IoT solutions and maintains the MIC platform.

## Telenor Start IoT: Free of charge Norwegian Pilot

[Telenor Start IoT](https://startiot.telenor.com/) is an initiative aiming at stimulating IoT innovation in Norway. Telenor Start IoT uses the MIC platform and gives Start IoT users free access to the platform for non-commercial use. The Start IoT initiative also distributes LPWAN dev kits for free to selected users and also allows users to use the NB-IoT, LTE Cat M1 and LoRaWAN networks that are part of the initiative free of charge. When following the workshops on this site you'll take advantage of the free offering Telenor Start IoT provides.

In the next page we will cover most of the reasons why you do want to use MIC instead of rolling out your own infrastructure. Let's get started!
