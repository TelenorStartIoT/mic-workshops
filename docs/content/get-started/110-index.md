This section will explain why the Managed IoT Cloud platform (short: MIC) is a powerful tool for managing your IoT infrastructure and why you should consider using it for your projects.

We'll start with a quick background about the MIC platform and who operates it to get you oriented.

## Telenor Connexion: Development

[Telenor Connexion](https://www.telenorconnexion.com/) is a branch in the Telenor company with its headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden. Telenor Connexion focuses on tailored IoT solutions and maintains the MIC platform.

## Telenor Start IoT: Norwegian Pilot

[Telenor Start IoT](https://startiot.telenor.com/) is an instance of the MIC platform open for the public as a test pilot. When following the workshops on this site you'll take advantage of the free offering Telenor Start IoT provides.

In the next page I'll cover most of the reasons why you'd want to use MIC instead of rolling your own infrastructure. Let's get started!
