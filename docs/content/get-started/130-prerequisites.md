The [Arduino MKR NB 1500](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkr-nb-1500) is fully compatible with Telenor Norways Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT) and LTE CAT M1 networks. In this workshop we'll go through how to provision a device in MIC and how to program the Arduino MKR NB 1500 to send data using the open `mda.ee` APN over the Telenor NB-IoT network.
