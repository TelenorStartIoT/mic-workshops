The [Arduino MKR NB 1500](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkr-nb-1500) comes fully compatible with Narrow Band IoT NB classes and LTE CAT M1 networks. In this workshop we'll go through how to provision a device in MIC and how to program the Arduino MKR NB 1500 to send data using the open `telenor.iot` APN over the Telenor NB-IoT network.

Before continuing, make sure that:

* You have a valid MIC account: https://startiot.mic.telenorconnexion.com/signup
* You are able to login to the MIC App Board: https://startiot.mic.telenorconnexion.com/login

{{< note title="App Board" >}}
The **App Board** is the web interface of Managed IoT Cloud. It is used to provision devices and create dashboards, but it is completely optional to use. Login here: https://startiot.mic.telenorconnexion.com/login
